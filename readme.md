# Logseq Plugin Sample Kit (TypeScript)

-   Sample kit for a simple Logseq plugin that does not require React or other tools.

## Features

1. **Localization (l10n) Setup**:

    - The plugin uses `logseq-l10n` to provide translations for user messages.
    - Language preferences are automatically detected and applied based on the user's Logseq settings.
    - See `src/translations/l10nSetup.ts` for implementation details.
    - [Logseq L10N Generate JSON-file](https://github.com/YU000jp/logseq-l10n-generate-json), [Logseq L10N Clone JSON-file](https://github.com/YU000jp/logseq-l10n-clone-json)

1. **Logseq Model Check**:
    - This plugin checks whether the Logseq app is a file-based or DB model (i.e. whether the current graph is a file-based or DB graph).
    - It updates the plugin's behavior and UI accordingly.
    - See `src/logseqModelCheck.ts` for implementation details.

## Preparing the repository

1. Clone this repository or use it as a template to create a new repository. <a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcf349bc-fb96-4d4e-afa7-e26aca1efb9d"/></a>
    - Configure the workflow permissions for the repository." Select "Read and write permissions". (Settings > Actions > General)
1. Match repository name, etc.
    - Replace all of the strings "YU000jp/logseq-plugin-sample-kit-typescript" in files in the folder.
    - Replace the value of "PLUGIN NAME" in the "release.config.js" file.
    - Replaces a personal name in the "LICENSE" file.
1. In the same folder as "package.json", run 'pnpm install' from a terminal.
1. "pnpm build" will generate an executable folder (converted to JavaScript).
    - It can now be loaded from developer mode.
    - During plugin development, reload from the plugin screen after changes have been made.

-   Note:
    1. The kit incorporates [logseq-l10n](https://github.com/sethyuan/logseq-l10n) so that translation by L10N can be provided.
        - When describing user messages, use `t("string")`.

## Steps to publish a plugin

1. Prepare an icon, approximately 64px in size.
    - If it is an SVG file, replace icon.svg.
    - If it is not an SVG file, place the file in the same folder as package.json and rewrite "icon.svg" in the "release.config.js" file.
1. Run the GitHub Actions Workflow to generate a public version of the release file.
    - Open the Actions tab, select 'Release' and then press the 'Run workflow' button.
    - If the manifesto has not been submitted, it will not yet be published at this stage.
1. Submit a manifesto to Logseq.
